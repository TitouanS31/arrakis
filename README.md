# Arrakis #
Arrakis is an OCamL/C# project created by Titouan Seraud and Hugo Girard during first semester of our 4th year of INSA. 
## What is Arrakis ? ##
This project implements [Ford-Fulkerson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm) using OCamL.  

It applies Ford-Fulkerson to a real-life problem: knowing if a (probably sport) team can still win a championship at a given moment.
